26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once.
The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Solution:

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        i,j=0,1
        while i<=j and j<len(nums):
            if nums[i]==nums[j]:
                j+=1
            else:
                nums[i+1]=nums[j]
                i+=1
        return i+1
